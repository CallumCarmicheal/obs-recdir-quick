# obs-recdir-quick

A simple and quick plugin to show the recording directory alongside a 
directory selector button inside OBS. 

This plugin is for those who forget to update their recording directory 
before hitting record. Now its always visible, 
taunting you if you somehow even forget now.

Project created from OBS Plugin Template.

# Issues

- The plugin does not update the recording directory text when ever the
configuration is changed from the settings panel as there doesn't seem to 
be an event to hook off or one way I know of yet. Although it does work if
you swap profiles.
